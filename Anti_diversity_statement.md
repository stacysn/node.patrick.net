Diversity destroys community.

All academic studies of the diversity have shown the same result: the more diverse a community, the less mutual trust, mutual understanding, and civic
engagement there is, because there is no longer any sense of shared purpose or values, or a shared past. Measures of selfishness, lonliness, and
meaninglessness all increase with diversity.

Worse, a goal of recruiting people based on their membership in some minority race or self-defined sexual grouping is simply another and yet more
pernicious form of discrimination. Github itself is guilty of this, explicitly counting numbers and percentages of desired groups based on nothing
other than this membership: https://diversity.github.com/

This project takes the opposite point of view: diversity for its own sake is entirely harmful, and completely irrelevant to the coding task at hand.
Coding is almost unique among professions that everyone is able to prove their own ability directly. Contributions to this project are welcome from
anyone based on quality alone. I don't want to know what your background is. No counting by race, gender, or any other discriminatory grouping will be
done here.
